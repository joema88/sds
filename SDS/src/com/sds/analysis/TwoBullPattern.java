/*
 *  So Bull Pattern deals is another less bull case of Bull Pattern One.
 *  Strong Bull Pattern One, the BT9 and 10 pass points usually overlapped and one after 
 *  another without much break period. Most stocks could not behave this strongly.
 *  What usually happens is that after T9, with or without 10 passing points  or sometimes
 *  even with a couple around 10 passing points, the stock enters into correction without
 *  another leg up T9. The correct usually last above 25 days and above 15% drop, during 
 *  correction period, AVG5 < AVG 20 (>=25 days), then comes with AVG5>AVG20 time.
 *  If it last longer than >12 days, then an relative safe up trend is set up. 
 *  The above 12 days AVG5>AVG20 may take one short above or several such before appears
 *  Since most stocks fall into this category, this may be a more important case than 
 *  bull pattern one. Bull pattern one usually find exceptional bull stocks, especially
 *  BT9 points are back to back closely.
 *  Pattern Two is usually good for pick up relative good stock on cheap and wait for up leg.
 *  Example: BIG, GNUS, TNDM,
 *  IF there is BT9 appears, then we could buy right after BT9 without +5% increase
 *  especially the SUM (TEAL+PINK+Yellow) for the BT9 period is >=5, even part of the BT9
 *  days is AVG5 <AVG20 period. That way you get much cheap entry buy point. (see FBIO)

/*
 * ONE TRICK IS TO MERGE SMALL FRAGMENTS (LESS THAN 13 DAYS) OF AVG5<AVG20 OR AVG5>AVG20 
 * INTO BIG CHUNK OF TREND, SMALL FRAGMENT AVG5>AVG20 PEAK (HIGHEST CLOSE) COULD BE USED
 * AS REFERENCE TO SEE IF THE FRAGMENT SHOULD BE ALIGNED BACKWARDS OR FORWARDS, UP OR DOWN
