1. FUC=8 OR 4 SEEMS TO BE A RELIABLE AND TIME EARLY INDICATOR OF BULL (MAYBE LACK OF VOLUME DATA)

SET @SYMB := 'LABU';

-- bull pattern within 30 days, 118 ->128->228(optional) then price above max from 118 bull buy like GE, FB, ADBE(danger)
SET @STOCK_ID := 4;

//VBI calculation logic is based on DD (days to deplete outstand stocks, i.e., markcap/close/dailyVolume) and D9 (10 day average of DD). VBI only detects latest DD compared to last 3 days (4 days data total), if DD drops more than 2/3 from any  of the previous 3 days, any VBI>=8 (18,28,108,118) indicates this, based on D9 change range 10% or 20%, the rest is determined, not sure how big the impact is. So VBI>=8 (especially VBI>=108) is an early indicator of strong buy or sell, very time sensitive (within a week or two). [ detail logic is in processVBIToday(int stockID, int dateId) of UpDownMeasure]
This metrics maybe should be combined with TBK (30 days outbreak pattern), pure Teal of latest and close price above the last 90% (>=27 days) of pink+yellow count of continuous 30 days). So TBK only consider P/Y/T and close pattern and close price over 30 days with no volume info. TBK+VBI --> considers short term heavy volume action with long term price breakout pattern. A good combination.
TBK AND VBI SHOULD NOT BE ON THE SAME DAY

FUC (U turn pattern) is based on last 250 days (one year) max drop DPC ( drop percentage from peak) and UPC (Up percentage from bottom of last 30 days), UTURN is defined UPC>40 and UPC-DPC>100 (FUC=8) or only UPC>40 and UPC-DPC<100, then FUC=4
So FUC+VBI --> considers short term heavy volume action with long term price bullish pattern. A good combination.
FUC AND VBI SHOULD NOT BE ON THE SAME DAY

FUC by itself is significant as it takes both intermediate (30 days) bullish pattern with long term correction pattern

EE8 is a combo of FUC and VBI of last 4 days, maybe this should be more days in between, like 25 to 30 days?...for FUC+VBI or TBK+VBI patterns
