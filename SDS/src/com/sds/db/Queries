1. Super bull query
//CCX 1 to 20, Pass Points sum >5, the bigger the better. 
//SUM of last 2 or 3 of PTVAL, PTVAL2 has some reference value, SUM PTVAL may be more important
select a.DATEID,CDATE, a.STOCKID,  DAYS,PTCP, PTVAL,PASS,CLOSE,CCX, PTCP2,DAY2,CX520,BDCX,BT9,BDW,b.SYMBOL FROM BBROCK a, SYMBOLS b,DATES c  WHERE a.STOCKID = b.STOCKID and a.DATEID=c.DATEID and ( b.SYMBOL='WST')  order by a.DATEID DeSC limit 2600;
//aslo observed that perfect BT9 bull is hard to come by
//we could relax the condition 10 out 9 Teal bar considered as a BT9 bull around AVG5>AVG20 junction
//i.e. CCX 1 to 20 or CCX -10 to -1 range, For example FF, MNST would qualify
//and make sense

2. Daily calculation comparison query (CIEN & CIEN2) to see error.

A. BASIC COMPARISION
