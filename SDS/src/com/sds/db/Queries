1. Super bull query
//CCX 1 to 20, Pass Points sum >5, the bigger the better. 
//SUM of last 2 or 3 of PTVAL, PTVAL2 has some reference value, SUM PTVAL may be more important
select a.DATEID,CDATE, a.STOCKID,  DAYS,PTCP, PTVAL,PASS,CLOSE,CCX, PTCP2,DAY2,CX520,BDCX,BT9,BDW,b.SYMBOL FROM BBROCK a, SYMBOLS b,DATES c  WHERE a.STOCKID = b.STOCKID and a.DATEID=c.DATEID and ( b.SYMBOL='WST')  order by a.DATEID DeSC limit 2600;
//aslo observed that perfect BT9 bull is hard to come by
//we could relax the condition 10 out 9 Teal bar considered as a BT9 bull around AVG5>AVG20 junction
//i.e. CCX 1 to 20 or CCX -10 to -1 range, For example FF, MNST would qualify
//and make sense

2. Daily calculation comparison query (CIEN & CIEN2) to see error.

A. BASIC COMPARISION
SELECT A.STOCKID, DATEID, PERCENT, CLOSE,NETCHANGE,ATR,OPEN,HIGH,LOW,LOW52,HIGH52,MARKCAP,VOLUME,YELLOW,TEAL,PINK FROM BBROCK A, SYMBOLS B WHERE A.STOCKID = B.STOCKID AND (B.SYMBOL='CIEN' OR B.SYMBOL='CIEN2') ORDER BY A.DATEID DESC LIMIT 30;

B. CALCULATION DAILY VS. HISTORY COMPARISON
SELECT DATEID, CLOSE,YELLOW,TEAL,PINK,SC5,YP10,BT9,TSC5,DAYS,PTVAL,PTCP,PASS,CX520,CCX,BDCX,BDW,PTCP2,DAY2, B.SYMBOL FROM BBROCK A, SYMBOLS B WHERE A.STOCKID = B.STOCKID AND (B.SYMBOL='CIEN' OR B.SYMBOL='CIEN2') ORDER BY A.DATEID DESC LIMIT 30;

3. BULL PASS WITH CX520
SELECT SYMBOL,COUNT(*) FROM BBROCK A, SYMBOLS B WHERE A.STOCKID=B.STOCKID AND PASS>3 AND CCX>0 AND CCX<=14 GROUP BY SYMBOL ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;


4. SUPER BULL SIGNAL BY STOCK NAME
SELECT C.CDATE, CLOSE,YELLOW,TEAL,PINK,SC5,YP10,BT9,TSC5,DAYS,PTVAL,PTCP,PASS,CX520,CCX,BDCX,BDW,PTCP2,DAY2, B.SYMBOL FROM BBROCK A, SYMBOLS B, DATES C WHERE A.STOCKID = B.STOCKID  AND A.DATEID = C.DATEID AND PASS>3 AND CCX>0 AND CCX<=14 AND (B.SYMBOL='AMZN') ORDER BY A.DATEID DESC LIMIT 300;

5. SUPER BULL STATISTICS QUERY
SELECT SYMBOL,COUNT(*) FROM BBROCK A, SYMBOLS B WHERE A.STOCKID = B.STOCKID AND PASS>3 AND CCX>0 AND CCX<=14 GROUP BY SYMBOL ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM BBROCK WHERE PASS>3 AND CCX>0 AND CCX<=14;
